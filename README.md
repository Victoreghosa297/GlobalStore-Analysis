The query focuses on analyzing profitability within the Global Superstore dataset for the year 2014. It first calculates the total profit by country and identifies the three countries that generated the highest overall profit during that year. Using a common table expression (CTE), these top-performing countries are isolated. Next, within each of these countries, the query evaluates individual products by summing their total profit. A ranking function (ROW_NUMBER()) is applied to order the products by profitability within each country. Finally, the query selects the top three products per country, showing the product names alongside their total profit. The result highlights not just which countries led in profit, but also the key products that contributed most to this success. This type of analysis helps businesses understand geographical performance and identify high-profit items driving growth, making it useful for strategic decisions in sales, marketing, and supply chain planning.
